# we use DISMODEL's program okadaio.f to compute Green Function.
# In order to call the function from python, it should be comiled.

f2py -c okadaio.f -m okadaio

# then the compiled file okada.so will be created in local dir
# Add enviroment variables into ~/.bash_profile
# Then source the ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile

# So can import the okada into python, then call it in program
